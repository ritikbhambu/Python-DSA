# When you write:
#   head
# You are referring to the entire node, which consists of two parts:
#   head.data â†’ the value stored in the node
#   head.next â†’ the reference to the next node (or None)
# So yes:
# ðŸ”¹ head includes both: data and next

#  When you write: 
#     head.next
# You are now referring to the next node (the one pointed to by head.next).
# And since every node has two parts:
# ðŸ”¹ head.next is also a full node, with:
#         head.next.data â†’ value of the next node
#         head.next.next â†’ pointer to the node after that
